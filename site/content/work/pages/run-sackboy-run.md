#### The Brief

Sony XDEV approached Firesprite Games to take the much beloved Sackboy, the knitted hero from the award winning LittleBigPlanet™ series and bring him and his new adventure across to Apple and Android devices in a brand new endless platformer. 

#### How we delivered

In taking a much beloved brand and character across to a non-PlayStation® platform for the first time, it was important that the quality and consistency of experience was maintained for both the creators and the players across a wide range of handsets and graphics architectures.

Firesprite Games leveraged its incredible art and technical capabilities to recreate the iconic environments, quirky characters and collectables to the highest fidelity possible, maintaining the strong visual look and charm that the franchise is known for across a variety of handsets, even low end devices.

Developed on a F2P business model with IAP, the game shipped with a variety of in-game unlockables and Leaderboards for players to compete and challenge eachother.

#### The Result

Run! Sackboy! Run! has since enjoyed over 10 million installs on devices since its launch and a huge praise from customers and the press alike.
