#### The Brief

The United States Air Force (USAF) approached Sony and Firesprite to create a bespoke experience for recruitment and to capture the training, preparation and experience of the special operations that they undertake with high altitude freefall operations.

#### How we delivered

Developed in close conjunction with combat controllers from the USAF, Air Force Special Ops: Nightfall utilises PlayStation VR to create an immersive, thrilling and interactive insight into the training and techniques employed in a "High Altitude Low Opening" (H.A.L.O) jump.

In close collaboration with experts from the USAF, Firesprite Games recreated the Military Freefall School in VR, giving players an introduction to the H.A.L.O jump techniques and the ability to learn the skills required for Jumping, Freefall, Canopy Control, Landing & Night operations, culminating in players testing their mettle in a simulated combat op.

The full range of PSVR features were utilised to capture the full experience of freefall and parachute descent,  including the recreation of an integrated heads up display (Navigometer) to provide telemetry to players about flight pose and heading alongside freefall and canopy controls operated by the PlayStation Move controllers.
