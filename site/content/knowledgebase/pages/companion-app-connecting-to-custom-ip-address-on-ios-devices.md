Within the Companion App, there is an option to input a "Custom" IP address in the interface to connect to a specific device on any internal network which is supported.

At present the IOS version of the app states "PS4 IP Location" for users to enter an IP address to connect to. This label is incorrect and is a bug.  The IP address of any compatible platform which supports The Persistence Companion App can be entered.
