If you are experiencing an issue downloading from the Google Play Store, it might be that there is an issue with your internet connection. If you are receiving an error code or the game download is not completing, the issue is likely with your connection to the Google Play Store or the Store itself.

To resolve issues such as this, please find Googles official troubleshooting steps on the page linked below:

<https://support.google.com/googleplay/troubleshooter/4592924>

If you have the game installed and you are encountering an issue downloading resources, it may be that there is a communication issue with Googles’ service.

To resolve this issue, please attempt the steps below;

1. Open your device **Settings**
2. Select **Date and Time**
3. Please make sure that you have **Automatic Date and Time** ticked

If this was not already enabled, please enable it and re-attempt to download the game.

If this was already the case and the issue is persisting, please attempt turning it off and setting the date back by 1 day.

4. Once you have done this, please attempt to re-install the game from the Store.

Should your problem persist at this point, it’s probably the case that there is an issue with Googles Licencing service or with your Google account
