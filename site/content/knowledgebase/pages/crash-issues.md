###### Android Devices

If you are experiencing a crash on a low end device, it might be that your device is over stressed. To resolve this, please close all other running applications and clear your RAM, then restart the app.

It may also be the case that some of the local app data has corrupted. To resolve issues such as this, please follow the steps below:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Applications** > **the game** you’re experiencing the issue with.\
   2. **Force Close the game**, so that it is no longer running.\
   3. Whilst still in **Settings** > **Applications**, go to **Google Play services** > **clear data**.\
   4. Whilst still in **Settings** > **Applications**, go to **Google Play Store** > **clear data**.
2. Whilst still in **Settings** > **Applications**, go to **the game** > **clear data** and **clear cache**.\
   6. **Turn your device off, and then turn it back on again**.\
   7. Attempt to launch and play the game.

***Warning:*** Clearing its data may result in the loss of any progress or customisation.

If you’re device is running a custom ROM, please know that the performance and stability of our apps cannot be guaranteed, and that you would need to seek support from the ROM developers.
