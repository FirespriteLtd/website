Up to 2 players can connect to a friend playing the game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation or PC. Help or Hinder your friends as they try to survive the doomed starship!

The companion app will allow connected players to see the procedurally generated decks of the ship and can guide the main player to his goal. You are armed with powerful tools which make a huge difference to their gameplay, the question is, do you want to help, or hinder?

* Open doors, and lure mutants away from the VR player’s path
* Discover hidden power-ups and guide the player to them
* Tag mutants so the VR player can see them coming
* Turn on more lights to help them
* Place markers to guide them
* Spawn weapons and health packs
* Freeze enemies to give the VR player a chance to run away
* Disable sentry guns so they can sneak past

But these powers don’t have to be used for good!

* Open doors, and lure enemies toward the VR player
* Spawn in even more enemies!
* Incite enemies to attack!
* And if your friend is already a little nervous, you can even turn the lights out!
