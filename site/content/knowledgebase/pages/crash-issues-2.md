Please ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for the game that you are experiencing an issue with.

To find the minimum required specification for a game, please locate its Steam Store listing and the System Requirements section on the page.

If your system does meet the games requirements, please ensure that your graphics drivers are fully up to date. To locate and install the latest drivers for your system please follow the appropriate link below:

NVIDIA: <https://www.geforce.co.uk/drivers>

AMD: <https://support.amd.com/en-us/download>

Intel: <https://downloadcenter.intel.com/>



If you believe that you meet the requirements for a game and that your drivers are up to date, please attempt to resolve any potential issues with the games local data by performing a file cache integrity check.

Please find the steps below for instructions on how to do this:

1. Load **Steam**
2. From the **Library** section, **right-click** on the game and select **Properties** from the menu.
3. Select the **Local files** tab and click the **Verify integrity of game cache…** button.
4. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.
5. Once the process is completed, the Check Window will automatically exit.
