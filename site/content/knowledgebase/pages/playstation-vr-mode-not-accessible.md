PlayStation 4 Pro users are not be able to access the VR mode in The Persistence after the 1.08 update onwards.

This is due to Supersampling being enabled in the settings menu on the PlayStation 4 Pro.

**Supersampling must be disabled for the VR mode to work.**

To resolve the issue, please head back to the following location on your PlayStation 4 Pro:

 Settings > Sound & Screen > Video Output Settings > Supersampling Mode

Then untick the box for "Enable Supersampling Mode".
