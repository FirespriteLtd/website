Updated at 6th July 2020.

After the latest 1.08 patch, we are aware that a number of users are unable to access and play the game in PlayStation VR mode.

In the meantime, try to disable Supersampling mode if it is enabled to see if this temporarily resolves the issue.

We are working on a patch for this issue and we hope to have it resolved in the coming weeks.
