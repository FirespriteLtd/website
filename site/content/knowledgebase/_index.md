**User guide/how to connect to the game**

The Persistence Companion app can only connect to The Persistence over a local network connection.

The mobile device being used to connect to The Persistence needs to be wirelessly connected to the same Wi-Fi router as the PlayStation®4 system. The PlayStation®4 system can be connected to the router via a cable.

The Persistence app uses Multicast to find the main game. Please ensure you have Multicast enabled on both your internet router and mobile device.
