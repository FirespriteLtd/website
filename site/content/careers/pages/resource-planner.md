##### THE ROLE

Due to continued growth and project expansion we have created an exciting new role within Firesprite and are hiring for a Resource Planner to join our production team. 

This is a pivotal role within our business that will report directly to our Studio Development Director and liaise closely with the Finance Director, Recruitment team and Managing Director to ensure all projects are resourced and planned for. 

You will have a genuine opportunity to own growth plans for the business and support the shape of strategic decision making throughout the future of Firesprite’s growth.

In order for you to understand the business and the team’s skills and experience, we require you to spend some time working on site in our studio to understand what our team do best, and how their technical strengths and experience fit so that you can effectively plan and resource for each project. However, we are happy for this role to eventually have a mix of remote and office working to suit the right person.
