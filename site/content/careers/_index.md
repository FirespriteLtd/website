        types, music lovers, culture addicts and freindly faces. Whether you
        fancy getting lost in it all at one of our many museums and galleries,
        going crazy at an exhilarating sporting event or gig, or just strolling
        along the waterfront and stopping to enjoy some world class food,
        Liverpool has got it covered.
