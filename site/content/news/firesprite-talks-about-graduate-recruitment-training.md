“*Gone are the incubation periods, graduate programmers are now learning by doing*”, explained Kate Birney to MCV, reiterating our approach to Graduate Recruitment & Training and providing more detail on how our graduates join a team with live projects.

Kate also details more about how our graduates work within a live team within Firesprite under more senior staff and "graduate" onto bigger and more challenging projects.
