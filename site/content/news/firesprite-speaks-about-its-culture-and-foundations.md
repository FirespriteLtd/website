Culture is massively important to us here at Firesprite so we jumped at the chance to talk about with *GamesJobsDirect* in their debut podcast series, where they shine a spotlight on the studios behind the projects, talking about culture, what it's like to work in these places in the day to day.

Graeme provides an insight into the history of the North-West's development scene and provides an insight into the founding years and goals for the business right through to present day, along with talking about our future ambitions.
