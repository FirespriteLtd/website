Firesprite speaks to Gamesjobsdirect about it's culture

It’s easy for studios to talk about their projects.

We hear about great games and new releases every day. But what about the studios that make them? What is it like to work behind the scenes on the games and experiences that we all know and love? You may know the games they make but what is it like to work in these games studios. What is the culture like? What is the best thing to come into day after day?

To answer all of these questions we’ve started the Games Jobs Direct Podcast! Every month we’ll be talking to a new studio about their culture, what makes their studio tick and what makes them such a fantastic place to work.

In the first installment, our[Marketing Manager Abbie](https://twitter.com/PirateAbbie)visited Firesprite in Liverpool. She chatted with Graeme Ankers, Managing Director and one of the original founders of the studio. Check out the very first episode of the podcast below:
