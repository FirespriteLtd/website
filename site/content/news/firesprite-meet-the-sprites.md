**What is your name and job title?**

Katherine Birney â€“ Studio Recruitment Co-ordinator

###### **Youâ€™re new to the games industry, how did you approach entering a new industry and what have you found to be the most challenging part?**

I think for me itâ€™s been understanding the roles, what each person does and how this makes up a project and studio. Iâ€™ve always played games, but never really thought about the industry much until I joined so itâ€™s been a learning curve! I think itâ€™s difficult to prepare for an industry you are new to so Iâ€™ve just tried to absorb all the information I can! ðŸ˜Š

###### **What is your favourite thing about working at Firesprite?**

I would say the people! I think Firesprite try really hard to make sure everyone is safe, happy and secure and its so important for an employer to value these aspects of working life and consider the health and wellbeing of their staff. I love that Firesprite is constantly growing and evolving, taking our opinions and ideas into consideration to create the best working environment for all of us.

###### You see a lot of CVs and applications every week, what makes a candidate really stand out from the crowd?

For me, the key thing I look for in an application is a well thought out, presented application because this shows a level of commitment, attention to detail and care and this helps create a great first impression! Clarify is really important too as hiring managers review lots of applications so I think itâ€™s always important to make sure you highlight your key accomplishments or best portfolio work to attract us and make sure this stands out right away. I also think its really important to be able to get an understanding of that person who is applying, what motivates them, what they are looking for in their next role and what they enjoy, this is always super useful to make the sure you can match a profile to a role and a role you know someone would enjoy!
