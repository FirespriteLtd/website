**About ‘The Persistence’**\
1291 light years away, The Persistence, an Eon-class colony vessel is caught in the inexorable pull of a black hole after a freak Dark Matter incident.With the entire crew mutated into horrific & murderous aberrations, it’s down to you, a stored memory printed & uploaded into a seemingly endless supply of disposable clones by the ship’s AI ‘IRIS’.A brutal VR sci-fi-horror with rogue-like elements featuring dozens of upgradable gear & weapons that may just be enough to keep you alive long enough to save The Persistence?
