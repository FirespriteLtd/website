Alongside discussing how management and game teams pull together across the various projects,  Rich recently sat down with Abbie to elaborate on our graduate recruitment and training. When graduates join the studio, they’re put into a team of 100 per cent other graduates:

*“They work together on services and platforms that have real-world deliveries and release schedules.”* explains Wood, *“They go through the full process, from ideation, development and release and that way they get the experience of what it’s like to work in a studio.” It works to develop their confidence and means they’re able to get feedback from both internal sources and real-world clients.*
