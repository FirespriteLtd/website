Games industry publication MCV speaks to Firesprite Games MD Graeme Ankers about the challenges and opportunities in bringing our title The Persistence to non-VR platforms.

"Going from VR to non-VR, the whole design language of the game is very different. Even how you treat a user interface, or taking account for where the player is sat in the experience is very different. So we’re changing that language completely moving to a flat screen version of the game, so there’s challenges around that, because you’re redesigning that system.”
