Following the announcement that The Persistence would be launching over in the coming months, we are pleased to finally confirm a release date for the title as we bring to new platforms including Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. The existing PlayStation version will also receive a free update 

Our publishing partner Perp Games will also be bringing the title to retail for a physical release later on this Summer. Watch this space!

Press Release as follows:

> Liverpool, UK - Thursday, 23rd April 2020 -Inventive independent developer Firesprite Games is excited to reveal that critically acclaimed sci-fi horror experience *The Persistence* will launch on PlayStation®4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on Thursday, May 21st, 2020.\
> \
> Having made waves on PSVR in 2018,*The Persistence* offers players an intentionally savage take on survival-horror that integrates an innovative rogue-like design into the genre, with its release on console and PC marking the first time it’s hit the 4K flat screen and Firesprite’s debut on both Nintendo and Microsoft platforms.\
> \
> *“When we made the move to bring The Persistence to new platforms, our key focus was to ensure that the particularly brutal nature of gameplay made the leap to non-VR,”* says Graeme Ankers, MD and founder of Firesprite Games.*“As a result, The Persistence keeps players on edge from beginning to end, and with a procedurally generated environment forming around them, no two playthroughs are ever identical, meaning you will never find safety in the same spot.”*\
> \
> As part of the new release, Firesprite Games is also pleased to confirm that gamers who already own the PlayStation®VR version will also receive these features via an update on PlayStation®4 for no extra cost.\
> \
> In addition, players who pre-purchase *The Persistence* on Nintendo Switch (between Thursday, April 23rd and Wednesday, May 20th) and Xbox One (between Thursday, April 30th and Wednesday, May 20th) will receive a 10 percent discount.\
> \
> Games Publisher Perp Games will publish physical editions across retail on the three console platforms. The release will be as near as possible to the digital release taking into account the effect of COVID 19 on global retail.
