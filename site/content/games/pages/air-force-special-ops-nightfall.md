### **Have you got what it takes?**

Assume the role of an Air Force Special Operations Airman and feel the exhilaration of a H.A.L.O. military free fall in VR – all from a first person perspective.  You’re a Special Ops trainee going to H.A.L.O. jump school – H.A.L.O. stands for High Altitude Low Opening, and it’s a military technique used to evade enemy detection. In jump school you will learn about key equipment used by Spec Ops Airmen and master a series of required skills, such as free fall, parachute control, and landing in day and night training operations.  

Complete training, then put your skills to the ultimate test in a simulated combat mission.
