features:
  - title: Death is just the beginning
    body: >-
      The only thing that stands in the way of saving the starship is an array
      of clone printed monstrosities, constantly replenished by the ship’s
      malfunctioning clone printer. If any encounter with these foes proves
      fatal, Zimri’s consciousness is uploaded into a new host body, ready for
      the next attempt
  - title: An ever-changing labyrinth
    body: >-
      The colony starship has a self-configuring macrostructure which can alter
      its internal architecture – and due to the catastrophic malfunction,
      that’s exactly what will happen. Upon awakening in a new cloned body or on
      teleporting between decks, the layout of the starship will change each
      time. Each and every expedition into The Persistence will be unique with
      different, items and gear to collect & upgrade.
  - title: 'Enhance, upgrade and augment. '
    body: >-
      The technology of the 26th century allows for genetic augmentation and
      manipulation of dark matter technology. Resequence Zimri’s DNA to improve
      health, toughness and defensive abilities or even harvest crew DNA to
      create cloned bodies of crewmembers to inhabit, each with their own unique
      abilities.
  - title: 'Explore, evade, fight and gather resources.'
    body: >-
      The mutated horde won’t think twice about tearing Zimri limb from limb.
      Use the environment to scope out, stalk and gain the tactical advantage in
      either evading or attempting to take them down.  Explore the decks of the
      ship and gather resources, weapons and suit customizations to aid survival
      in the journey deeper into the dark and terrifying depths.
  - title: Asymmetric Multiplayer
    body: >-
      Connect a phone or tablet running IOS or Android* to the game for up to 4
      players to take control of ‘Solex’ – the ship’s engineering system. Once
      connected, they will be able to take control of the ship’s systems in
      realtime, including abilities to lure creatures, open doors and disable
      any of the ship’s internal security defenses.
