features:
  - title: VR and Stealth - a perfect match
    body: >-
      The heart-pounding thrills of a stealth game are raised to new levels by
      the immersive presence of VR. Sneaking around, hiding behind cover – feel
      the adrenalin pumping as you lean out of safety to see the terrifying
      dangers that stalk you in the dark.
  - title: Different every life
    body: >-
      The Persistence's macrostructure is malfunctioning, rearranging the deck
      modules into random configurations. Procedurally generated decks mean that
      no two games of *The Persistence* will play the same – and every time you
      awaken in another clone host, a new challenge awaits you on the next deck.
  - title: Connect to a friend
    body: >-
      Connect a phone or tablet running IOS or Android* to the game for up to 2
      players to take control of ‘Solex’ – the ship’s engineering system. Once
      connected, they will be able to take control of the ship’s systems in
      realtime, including abilities to lure creatures, open doors and disable
      any of the ship’s internal security defenses.

##### Can you survive?

The Persistence is a brutal VR sci-fi-stealth, horror, roguelike featuring dozens of upgradable gear & weapons that may just be enough to keep you alive long enough to survive.

Caught in the inexorable pull of a black hole, and with the crew mutated into horrific & murderous aberrations, it’s down to you, a clone of security office Zimri Eder, to save the ship and make the jump back to earth. Every time you die, you print a new (and potentially improved) clone of yourself. There’s a slim chance you could still escape, and take back your life, if only you can survive the horrors onboard and repair the ship’s devastated systems
