### Open the door to a world of fun

Pre-installed on every PlayStationÂ®4, THE PLAYROOM is available straight out of the box. 

Make new friends and reveal the AR Bots that live inside your DUALSHOCK 4 wireless controller. Use the touchpad to flick them onto your screen and then see how they react to your on-camera actions. Wave to them or kick and swat them across the room.

Summon the smart, cheeky robot named ASOBI and have fun together in your own living room or challenge a friend to a holographic game of Air Hockey using your DUALSHOCK 4 wireless controller's motion controls.

Combining the Playstation Camera with the unique features of the DUALSHOCK 4 wireless controller, THE PLAYROOM is chock full of augmented reality fun. 

Ignite your imagination with a variety of different and engaging experiences!
