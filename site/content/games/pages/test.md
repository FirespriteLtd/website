##### Can you survive?

Caught in the inexorable pull of a black hole, and with the crew mutated into horrific & murderous aberrations, it’s down to you, a clone of security office Zimri Eder, to save the ship and make the jump back to earth. Every time you die, you print a new (and potentially improved) clone of yourself. There’s a slim chance you could still escape, and take back your life, if only you can survive the horrors onboard and repair the ship’s devastated systems.

A brutal VR sci-fi-stealth, horror, roguelike featuring dozens of upgradable gear & weapons that may just be enough to keep you alive long enough to survive.

##### Death is not the end

The Persistence is procedurally generated. Every time you die and a new clone of Zimri is printed, the layout of the ship has changed. Every life will play out differently, with different enemies to face, items to find and power-ups to collect.

Survival requires you to be stealthy and VR is the perfect match for this. Sneaking around and hiding behind cover; it's second nature in VR to just lean round or peek over cover to gain the advantage.

Your friends can also help by connecting to the game with their phone or tablet and hacking into the ship's computer. Once in the ship's system, players get to control doors, freeze or distract enemies, disable traps and find hidden items to scavenge for the VR player. Be aware though, sometimes the tablet player gets rewarded if you die, do you trust your friends?

The Persistence is a procedurally generated VR sci-fi-stealth, horror game, exclusively for PlayStation®VR.
