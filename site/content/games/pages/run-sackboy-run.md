#### RUN as fast as you can through an ever-changing handcrafted world!

Sackboy, the knitted hero from the multi-award winning LittleBigPlanet™ series on PlayStation® lands into the palm of your hand in this brand new endless platformer!\
\
Get ready to run like the wind in a blistering adventure with the nasty Negativitron nipping at your heels.

### Power-up and upgrade!

Whilst running across LittleBigPlanet, your Sackboy can utilise special Power-ups to aid them in their escape of the Negativitron and collect bonus goodies!

*The Magnet*- The nifty little device will pull all nearby Bubbles and Prize Bubbles towards you as you run.

*The Jetpack*- Grab this and jet off to a secret route that's just chock full of bonus bubbles to collect.

*The Glider* - Hit a Bounce Pad with the glider equipped and glide high above the ground to avoid danger and collect bubbles.

You can even spend your hard-earned Bubbles to give each of these Power-ups a permanent Upgrade!
